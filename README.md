# Traveltek coding challenge

A react app with expressjs backend api to access flight information

## Requirements

Produce an API designed to run as a web service that can output flight data from "flightData_A.xml" in a JSON format.

Then create a web-page that that can retrieve the data from the API, and process it to produce the following data points:

– How many of the flights depart in the morning (before 12 AM)?
– What percentage of the total set of flights fly into Sweden?
– What are the 10 most popular destination airports?
– What’s the average journey time between London Heathrow (LHR) and Dubai (DXB)?
– At least one other statistic that you find interesting

## Installation
